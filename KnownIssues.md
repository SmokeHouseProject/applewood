> Building electron apps may fail on Mac with a `resource busy` error message. It appears the DMG mount remembers that is has mounted the DMG file and then reports as being busy. The only work around that I have found to-date is to reboot the MAC.
Please see [README](dist/README.md) 

> The Aurelia CLI command `au build` fails. It appears this is an internal bug in the Aurelia CLI and hopefully will be resolved soon. The `au run` command does a build without error so please just use it for now.
