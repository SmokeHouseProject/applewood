This folder is automatically updated by a modified aurelia [build script](../aurelia_project/tasks/build.js)

It automatically updates the following files and directories:
-  index.html
-  favicon.ico
-  main.js
-  config.xml
-  cordova.js
-  /fonts
-  /images
-  /locales
-  /scripts
-  /styles

>The package.json is not copied from the root. It is a specific version for the electron build and must be edited manually.

>The cordova files are polyfills required to run in a browser

>The package-lock.json file is an artifact of the build process and does not need to be preserved.
