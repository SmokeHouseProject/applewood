This folder is automatically updated by a modified aurelia [build script](../aurelia_project/tasks/build.js)

It only copies the following files:
-  index.html
-  styles.css
-  /scripts
-  /images

>The main.js file is a production version with the debugging window hidden.  
>This file must be manually edited.

>The node_modules folder is an artifact of the build process and is empty
